The traditional arcade game Asteroids takes place on a toroidal manifold. This means that the top and the bottom of the screen are connected, as are the right and the left sides of the screen. Playing on a torus is fun - it allows you to go as fast as you want while never leaving the bounds of a finite 2d screen. But a torus is not the only topology that can be used. We could also play asteroids on a klein bottle, a projective plane, or a non-euclidean manifold.

This is an ongoing project to explore how these different spaces might effect gameplay.
The core software for these games was taken from [Doug McInnes](https://github.com/dmcinnes/HTML5-Asteroids). His script has been slightly modified here to warp space in various ways.
